USAGE for Stack rendering Examples

========================================================================
 Common

a. When the examples are executed, the applications ask for users to 
select which Stack would be used. The list of Stacks from a file "FIRST".

b. As this application uses data which locations of them are already 
determined, please follow the directory hierarchy

c. It comprises three types of rendering for each applications

  (1) render 
    Rendering EM and Stack using ray-casting. It uses pre-defined 
   transfer function

  (2) max_intensity_rendering
    Rendering EM using alpha compositing and rendering stack using 
   Maximum Intensity Projection

  (3) separate rendering
    Rendering EM (ray-casting) and Stack (Maximum Intensity Projection) 
   individually, and combine it using blending

1. rendering.vvl

HOW TO USE

vivaldi rendering.vvl [number for stack data : optional]

# When the 'number for stack data' is given, it renders 360 degree
 rotation for x axis

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. rendering_viewer.vvl

HOW TO USE

vivaldi rendering_viewer.vvl


# It serves viewer to control orientation, transfer function, and 
 slider for optional usage.

   (1) Orientation
     Orientation of Object is controlled by mouse. A left button 
    supports rotation, a right button supports scale of object. And
    a middle button supports translation. (This controls are supported
    on left widget, rendering widget)

   (2) Transfer function
     Examples supports transfer function on viewer. The right up side
    of viewer represents the transfer function. Middle button supports
    to choose the color, and right button dye a pallete. And diagonal 
    line represents alpha (opacity) of a voxel value.

   (3) Slider
     When ` sld='SLIDER' ` is used in enable_viewer function in main, 
    slider is enabled. The slider acts for the value, 'slider' and 
    'slider1' in worker function. It assigned from 0 to 99, and users
    can control the value interactively.
